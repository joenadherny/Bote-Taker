I have all the routes set up correctly and I can not get the second page to render correctly, I don't know what else to do as I know my sever is set up correctly and the frontend is already done so I don't know why I can't figure it out. I stil deployed on Heroku and tried to meet as much acceptance criteria as possible to meet the minimum.
